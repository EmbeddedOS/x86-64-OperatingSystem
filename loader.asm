; The loader code is put on sectors [1:5] in our hard disk image, after the BIOS
; found the boot sector, we will use the boot code to load the loader code into
; physical memory at address 0x7E00. First of all, to prepare to long mode, we
; need to check it is supported or not. That is done by using `cpuid`
; instruction and it's service: "EAX Maximum Input Value for Extended Function 
; CPUID Information.". After that we load 100 sectors [6:105] which we have
; spent for our kernel code (51200 bytes are enough for our kernel code). Now
; the physical memory look like:
;              Memory
;      |-------------------| Max size
;      |      Free         | -> We will use this region for kernel code.
;      |-------------------|0x00100000
;      |      Reserved     |
;      |-------------------| 0x80000
;      |      Free         |
;      |-------------------|
;      |      Loader       | 0x7E00
;      |-------------------|
;      |     MBR code      | 0x7C00
;      |-------------------|
;      |      Free         | -> We used this region for stack.
;      |-------------------|
;      | BIOS data vectors |
;      |-------------------| 0
;
; After that, we will check everything is fine for protected mode such as: valid
; memory, A20 is already enable, etc. So, one thing we need to note is set video
; mode, because after we switch to protected mode, we can not use BIOS service
; anymore, so we need set video mode, and from that point, we can print to
; screen via the video base address 0xB8000. Next thing we need to do is switch
; to Protected Mode. To do this we need to prepare some thing:
; - Load Global Descriptor Table: Main purpose of this table is management
;   segment, decentralize permission to segments, set attributes to them such as
;   readable, wriable, etc.
; - Load Interrupt Descriptor Table: Register handler for interrupt lines.
; But we will not deal with interrupts until we switch to Long Mode. So we will
; load LDT with a NULL table. After switch to Protected Mode, we need to jump it
; code segment with Protected Mode entry. PM provides a way to jump to segments,
; `Segment Selector` that represents for index, permission, etc. of segment in
; GDT. For example, the code segment descriptor is index 1 in the GDT, we have
; selector equal 0b00001000 = 0x08.
; The main purpose of protected mode in our system is preparing for Long mode,
; because we can not jump from 16 bit mode to 64 bit mode, that is impossible.
; So after we, switch to PM, we immediately prepare for long mode, there is list
; job we need to do:
; - Prepare for paging: why we need to do that? because we need to enable paging
;   , and this require a structure to manage the current page. We will not run
;   run on PM mode so we will load it with a dummy structure, we do that by
;   selecting a free region about 0x70000 up to 0x80000.
; - Load GDT: in long mode, almost fields at segment descriptor will be ignored.
;   we will only set first entry is code segment (in Long mode, segmentation is 
;   disabled), `ds`, `es`, `ss` are ignored also.
; - Enable long mode by setting bits in special registers (cr4, cr3, msr).
; - Enable paging by setting bit[31] in cr0 register.
; After switch to long mode, final missions of loader code are relocated kernel
; code from address 0x10000 to 0x200000 and finally jump to it. So from now we
; can run kernel code and user application in 64 bit mode. Congratulation!
